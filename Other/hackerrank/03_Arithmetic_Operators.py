# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# Example


# Print the following:

# 8
# -2
# 15

num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())

sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2

print(sum)
print(difference)
print(product)
