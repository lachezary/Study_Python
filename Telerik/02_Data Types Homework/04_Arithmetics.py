# Read two numbers from the console and calculate:

# The sum of a and b
# The difference when a is subtracted from b
# The product of a and b
# The remainder when a is divided by b
# The result of a powered to b
# Input
# On the first line you will receive a number a
# On the second line you will receive a number b
# Output
# You should print the sum, the difference, the product the remainder and the power
