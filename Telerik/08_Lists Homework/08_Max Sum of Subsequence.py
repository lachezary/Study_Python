# consecutive elements in a given array of N numbers.

# Can you do it with only one loop 
# (with a single scan through the elements of the array)?
# Input
# On the first line, you will receive the number N
# On the next N lines, the numbers of the array 
# will be given
# Output
# Print the maximal sum of consecutive numbers
