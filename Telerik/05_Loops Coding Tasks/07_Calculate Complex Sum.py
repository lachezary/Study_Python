# Write a program that, for a given two numbers N and X, calculates the sum S = 1 + 1!/x + 2!/x2 + â€¦ + N!/xN.

# Use only one loop. Print the result with 5 digits after the decimal point.
# Each element is calculated as follows: (previous_element) * i / xi

# Output
# Output only one number - the sum of the sequence for the given N and X.
